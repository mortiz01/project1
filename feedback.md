# Project 1 Evaluation
[inline code comments](1)
## Planning / Process / Submission
**1: Progressing**
>App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application

## Technical Requirements
**2: Performing**
>App functions with minimal or no errors and is deployed on github pages

## Code Quality
**1.5: Progressing**
>Code lacks proper formatting, includes commented out, non-functional code, or otherwise contains major issues of quality (DRY, naming, etc)
>The parts that are working are working fine.  There are a few non functional pieces and a good bit of code that should not be in your deployed branch.  

## Creativity and Interface
**1: Progressing**
>The app is styled and has an interface of value to the end user: it is not just a nav bar and an index page
